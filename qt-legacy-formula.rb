    At the request of Homebrew maintainers, the Qt 4 formula has been
    renamed from `qt` to `qt@4`. You may need to re-run qmake/cmake and
    recompile any software that uses Qt 4.
    
    If you wrote a script/package/formula that installs Qt 4, consider 
    find-replacing "nzanepro/qt4/qt" with "nzanepro/qt4/qt-webkit@2.3" if you
    need Webkit support or "nzanepro/qt4/qt@4" if you don't.
